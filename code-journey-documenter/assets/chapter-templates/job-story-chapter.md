# Chapter [X]: [Title Based on Job Story]

> *"[Opening quote or memorable moment from the session]"*

## The 2AM Problem

[Start in medias res. Put the reader in your shoes. What was the pressure? The stakes? The confusion?]

It was [time/context], and I was staring at [the problem]. The [system/feature/bug] had [specific symptom], and [why it mattered - deadline, users affected, personal stakes].

I'd already tried [prior attempts without Claude Code]. None of it worked because [why those approaches failed].

## Enter Claude Code

My first prompt was almost desperate:

```
[Your initial prompt, verbatim]
```

[What happened. Be honest about your expectations vs. reality.]

Claude Code responded by [summary of response]. I watched as it [specific actions - files touched, commands run].

The result: [outcome - worked, partial, failed].

## The Iteration

[This is where learning happens. Walk through your prompt refinements.]

What I realized was [insight that led to next prompt]. So I tried:

```
[Refined prompt]
```

This time, [what changed]. The key difference was [specific improvement or new problem].

[Continue for significant iterations. Each should teach something.]

## The Failure That Taught Me

[Don't skip failures. They're gold.]

At [timestamp/point], everything broke. [Describe the failure vividly.]

The mistake was [what went wrong]. I had assumed [your assumption], but [reality].

This taught me [the lesson]. In Claude Code terms, the pattern is: [transferable insight].

## The Breakthrough

[The moment it clicked.]

Finally, I understood: [the core insight].

The prompt that worked:

```
[The successful prompt]
```

[Why this one worked when others didn't. Be specific about the difference.]

## The Pattern

From this session, I extracted a pattern I now use regularly:

**[Pattern Name]**: [One-sentence description]

When you encounter [situation], structure your prompt to [technique]. The key is [what makes it work].

### When to Use This Pattern

- [Situation 1]
- [Situation 2]
- [Situation 3]

### When NOT to Use This Pattern

- [Anti-situation 1]
- [Anti-situation 2]

## Try It Yourself

Here's how you can practice this pattern:

**Setup:** [What the reader needs]

**The Prompt:**
```
[A prompt readers can try with their own code]
```

**Expected Outcome:** [What should happen]

**If It Doesn't Work:** [Troubleshooting guidance]

## Reflection

Looking back, this session changed how I think about [aspect of Claude Code usage].

Before, I would [old behavior]. Now, I [new behavior].

The deeper lesson is [philosophical/meta insight about AI-assisted development].
