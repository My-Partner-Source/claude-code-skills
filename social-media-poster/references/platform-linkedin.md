# LinkedIn Platform Guidelines

## Hard Constraints

- **Character limit**: 3,000 characters per post
- **"See more" fold**: ~210 characters before truncation
- **Hashtags**: 3-5 recommended (unlike X, these help discovery)
- **Links**: Can hurt reach—consider putting in comments instead

## Platform Culture

LinkedIn rewards:
- Professional framing (but not corporate speak)
- Vulnerability about career struggles
- Concrete lessons from experience
- Content that makes readers look smart if they share it

LinkedIn penalizes:
- Engagement bait ("Comment YES if you agree")
- Controversial hot takes (unlike X)
- Overly casual tone
- Negativity without resolution

## Post Structure

### The Hook (First Line)

The first line before "See more" is everything. It must:
- Create curiosity or tension
- Be self-contained (make sense without the rest)
- Avoid starting with "I"

**Pattern: Hook → Space → Substance → Space → CTA → Hashtags**

### Formatting

```
[Hook line - pattern interrupt, <210 chars]

[Substance - 2-4 short paragraphs]

[Each paragraph 2-3 sentences max]

[Use single-line breaks for readability]

[Takeaway or call to action]

#Hashtag1 #Hashtag2 #Hashtag3
```

### Line Breaks Matter

LinkedIn's algorithm favors "dwell time" (how long people read). Use:
- Short paragraphs (1-3 sentences)
- Single sentences on their own lines for emphasis
- White space to create breathing room

## Hashtag Strategy

Unlike X, hashtags matter on LinkedIn:
- Use 3-5 hashtags
- Place at the end of the post
- Mix broad (#SoftwareEngineering) and specific (#ClaudeCode)
- Check hashtag follower counts—aim for 10K-500K followers

### Recommended Hashtags for Dev Content

```
#SoftwareEngineering (large, broad)
#Programming (large, broad)
#WebDevelopment (medium)
#AI (large, trending)
#DeveloperProductivity (smaller, targeted)
#TechCareers (medium)
#CodingLife (medium)
#LearnToCode (if educational)
```

## Content Types That Work

### The Lesson Learned

```
I mass-applied to 400 companies in 2019.

Got 3 responses.

Last month? 15 applications, 11 interviews.

What changed wasn't AI or fancy tools.

It was this:

[3-4 paragraphs of substance]

The job market is brutal. But targeted > spray and pray.

### The Framework/List

```
5 things I wish I knew before mass-applying to developer jobs:

1. [Point]
2. [Point]
3. [Point]
4. [Point]
5. [Point]

The market is tough, but strategy beats volume every time.

### The Story

```
My worst job interview taught me more than my best one.

[Story with setup, conflict, resolution]

[What I learned]

Sometimes rejection is redirection.

#Interviews #CareerLessons #TechCareers
```

### The Contrarian (Gentle)

```
Unpopular opinion: You don't need to mass-apply to find a job.

[Reasoned argument with evidence]

[Acknowledge the other side]

[Your conclusion]

What's worked for you?

## What NOT to Do

- **Engagement pods**: LinkedIn penalizes coordinated engagement
- **Comment bait**: "Comment 'GUIDE' to get my free PDF"
- **Negativity without insight**: Complaining without teaching
- **Humble brags**: "So humbled to announce..." (just announce it)
- **Walls of text**: No line breaks = no reads
- **Links in post body**: Put in comments to avoid reach penalty
- **Tagging people who didn't ask**: Feels spammy

## Link Strategy

LinkedIn deprioritizes posts with links (they want users to stay on platform).

**Options:**
1. Put link in first comment, mention "link in comments"
2. Use link only if essential to the post
3. For threads/articles, use LinkedIn's native article feature

## Posting Cadence

- 2-4 posts per week is sustainable
- Consistency beats frequency
- Best times: Tuesday-Thursday, 7-9 AM or 12-1 PM (local timezone)
- Engage with comments for 30-60 min after posting (algorithm boost)

## Voice Calibration

LinkedIn sits between X (casual) and formal writing:

| Too Casual (X voice) | Just Right | Too Formal |
|---------------------|------------|------------|
| "lol this bug" | "This bug taught me something" | "I encountered an issue" |
| "shipped it 🚀" | "Finally shipped the feature" | "I am pleased to announce" |
| "hot take:" | "Unpopular opinion:" | "I would like to posit" |

## Engagement Strategy

- Reply to every comment in first hour (signals engagement to algorithm)
- Ask follow-up questions to commenters
- Thank people for sharing (but don't overdo it)
- Cross-post wins from X as slightly longer LinkedIn versions
